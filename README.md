## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project allowed me to better understand the use of Tailwind CSS. made me use media query and custom css that I had rarely used before, making me understand a little more about them.

### Continued development

I intend to continue using Tailwind CSS to improve my styling skills and also use other tools (probably NextJS) in future projects to expand my knowledge.
